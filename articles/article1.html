                        <p>Mental health problems don't only affect adults. Children, teens and young adults can have
                            mental health problems, too. In fact, three out of four people with mental health problems
                            showed signs before they were 24 years old.</p>

                        <h2>What Does “Mental Health Problem” Mean?</h2>

                        <p>Are you having trouble doing the things you like to do or need to do because of how you
                            feel—like going to school, work or hanging out with friends?</p>

                        <p>Are you having a rough day? Have you been feeling down for a while? Everyone goes through
                            tough times, and no matter how long you've had something on your mind, it's important that
                            you talk to someone about it.</p>

                        <p>Talk to your parents or a trusted adult if you experience any of these things:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Can't eat or sleep</li>
                            <li>Can't perform daily tasks like going to school</li>
                            <li>Don't want to hang out with your friends or family</li>
                            <li>Don't want to do things you usually enjoy</li>
                            <li>Fight a lot with family and friends</li>
                            <li>Feel like you can't control your emotions and it's affecting your relationships with
                                your family and friends</li>
                            <li>Have low or no energy</li>
                            <li>Feel hopeless</li>
                            <li>Feel numb or like nothing matters</li>
                            <li>Can't stop thinking about certain things or memories</li>
                            <li>Feel confused, forgetful, edgy, angry, upset, worried, or scared</li>
                            <li>Want to harm yourself or others</li>
                            <li>Have random aches and pains</li>
                            <li>Smoke, drink, or use drugs</li>
                            <li>Hear voices</li>
                        </ul>



                        <h2>Where Can I Get Help?</h2>

                            are also lots of people who want to help you.

                            <li>Respects your need for privacy so you can tell him or her anything</li>
                            <li>Lets you talk freely about your feelings and emotions without judging, teasing, or
                                criticizing</li>
